## Ben Partington

I am an aspiring Junior Developer, with a keen interest in design. I have a background in art, design and photography. I've worked tirelessly to learn how to code within the past 6 months and gain a place on a highly selective coding bootcamp. I've always loved creating things, so what really excites me about tech is the ability to create new worlds, to use my creativity and ingenuity to bring a fresh approach to problem solving and work in an industry that constantly evolves and innovates.

## Skills

Teamwork Skills - At Culture Trip I worked as part of the visual media team to produce several editions of the Culture Trip magazine. My contribution involved contacting featured businesses to secure press images, curating those images and making sure my work was in line with the strict team deadlines. I worked with my team in meetings and 1-2-1 to ensure we were all working towards a common goal and on schedule. As a result, we delivered the magazine on time and created a high quality piece of work we were all very proud of.

Organisational Skills - At Ikon Science I successfully helped to organise software training courses for 2 years. My contributions involved scheduling, organising catering and attendee feedback, as well as organising training materials for in-house and remote courses. I made sure that all attendees received the necessary information and materials before, during and after the course. As a result, in addition to receiving excellent feedback from my line manager, the training area of the business continued to be highly successful and ran hundreds of fully booked courses throughout my time at the company.

Attention to detail - Whilst working as an artist for Siege Studios I completed mutiple commissions to an extremely high standard, and always went above and beyond to put extra effort and (literal) detail into my painting commissions. This role demanded an incredible attention to detail and the ability to follow a client specification closely, whilst also being able to improvise, creatively interpret and expand on the instruction therein. I contributed to the continued rapid expansion and success of the business, and received excellent feedback on all my projects.
